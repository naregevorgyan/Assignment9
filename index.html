                <h2>About</h2>
                <p id="lineHeight">Yousuf Karsh, an Armenian-Canadian photographer, was celebrated for his extraordinary ability to capture the essence of his subjects, making him one of the most respected portrait photographers of the 20th century. Fleeing the Armenian Genocide, he eventually settled in Canada, where his passion for photography flourished under the mentorship of his uncle, George Nakash, a photographer in Quebec. Karsh's work is distinguished by its dramatic use of light and shadow, meticulously crafting images that reveal the inner depth and character of his subjects. Among his most iconic works is the 1941 portrait of Winston Churchill, capturing the indomitable spirit of the British leader during World War II.</p>
